    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        Since childhood, I have always been fascinated by technology and how it impacts our daily lives. The idea of creating something from scratch and solving complex problems using logic has always intrigued me. As I pursued my education in Information Technology, my interest in coding grew exponentially. I realized that software development is not just about writing code but also about building solutions that make a difference. The ever-evolving nature of the field excites me because it offers continuous learning opportunities. I aspire to be a part of this dynamic world where I can contribute meaningfully by creating innovative software solutions.
